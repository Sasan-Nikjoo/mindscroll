Development Log: Mindscroll

Date: February 4, 2026 Developer: Sasan Nikjoo Tech Stack: Next.js (App Router), SQLite, Tailwind CSS


🚀 Accomplishments
Started the "Mindscroll" project from scratch. Transitioned from a default template to a functional Full-Stack application with custom Authentication and Database management.
1. Architecture & Database

    Engine: Chose SQLite for a lightweight, portable, local database.

    Connection: Implemented a direct connection using the sqlite3 library (bypassing ORMs like Prisma for direct control).

    Schema Management: Created tables manually using DB Browser for SQLite.

    Database Schema:

        users: Stores id, username, email, and securely hashed password.

        posts: Stores id, title, content, created_at, and authorId (Foreign Key).


2. Authentication System (Custom Build)

    Sign Up:

        Built a Server Action to handle form submissions.

        Implemented bcryptjs to hash passwords (security best practice) before storing in SQLite.

    Login:

        Implemented logic to look up users by email.

        Added password verification using bcrypt.compare.

    Session Management:

        Integrated iron-session to manage secure, encrypted cookies.

        Users stay logged in across page reloads.

    Logout:

        Added functionality to destroy the session cookie and redirect to the home page.


3. Core Features (The Blog)

    Write Post:

        Created a protected route (/new-post) accessible only to logged-in users.

        Implemented database insertion linking the new post to the logged-in user's ID.

    Read Feed:

        Updated the Home Page to fetch all posts from SQLite.

        Implemented a JOIN query to display the Author's username alongside their post title and content.

4. UI/UX

    Cleaned up the default Next.js boilerplate.

    Implemented conditional rendering in the Header:

        Guest: Shows "Login / Sign Up".

        User: Shows "Hi, [Username]", "Write Post" button, and "Logout" button.
